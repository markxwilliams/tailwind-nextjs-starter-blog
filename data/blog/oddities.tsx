## Introduction

I've worked in the Australian cyber security industry since 2016. It's not without its oddities. 

## "Australian Experience" 

When I first moved to Australia, multiple recruiters asked me the same question: "Do you have experience in Australia?". Despite having then 11 years' expeience in cyber security -- in New Zealand, the UK, and Germany -- this was a question that I was seriously asked. 

What makes Australia special such that one requires "Australian experience"? Nothing. Business culture is similar to New Zealand. In the UK there's a lot more complaining and drinking after work. In Germany... well, that's a topic for another day.

Unsurprisingly, nine years later, I've seen nothing significantly different Australia's business culture compared to the other countries in which I've worked. 

## The ACSC

The [Australian Cyber Security Centre](https://www.cyber.gov.au), brought you you by the ASD... a [spy agency](https://www.asd.gov.au/about/accountability-governance/publications/asd-corporate-plan-2021-22/asds-purpose). Notoriously, Edward Snowden showed the ASD's [involvement](https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/07/09/australian-signals-directorate-book/) in [mass](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/edward-snowden-documents-reveal-indonesian-phone-networks-penetrated-by-australian-spies-20140216-32tyu.html) [surveillance](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-14/documents-reveal-new-details-in-australias-bid-for-nsa-spy-help/5453764).

However, despite the ASD's [clear conflict of interest](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2009/03/who_should_be_in_cha.html), the ACSC's [Essential 8](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cybersecurity/essential-eight) is followed religiously by many Australian organisaitons. The Essential 8 is cyber security 101; it's nothing you can't find in any cyber security textbook, course, or sprawled across the Internet. 
                                                                                                                                              
Despite beiing part of a spy agency, the ACSC is rarely, if ever, criticised by cyber security professionals.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
## "I'm a CISO"

No, you're not a CISO. You don't have the word "Chief" in your title, and you still report to someone who reports to the CIO. Australian cyber security managers' egos continue to amaze me.
