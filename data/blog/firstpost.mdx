## Introduction

Thank you to Timothy Lin & Guillermo Rauch for such great software. This blog is powered by Timothy Lin's [Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) and Guillermo Rauch's [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com). 

There is so much fantastic open source and free software. Image 20 years ago being able to fork a repository and then run the code on serverless infratructure for free, including a custom domain name and SSL certificate.
