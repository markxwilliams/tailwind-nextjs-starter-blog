## Introduction

You're a security/solution/domain/program architect who's been given a PAM project. Now what? These next few blog posts aim to answer that question based on my experience. I will walk through how to structure PAM capabilities, functional requirements, current state architecture, reference architecture, vendor selection, and the solution architecture/design of your chosen PAM solution.

> [!NOTE]
> This blog won't go into mapping business objectives to business/technical capabilities. It's assumed that your PAM project is funded, has its business objectives defined, and you're wondering about the next steos.
