## Overview

I'm a security and identity architect with over 20 years' experience in cyber security, across financial services, manufacturing, government, and logistics.

Recently I've been focused on CIAM (customer identity and access mangement) and PAM (privileged access management). I'm especially passionate about CIAM, because many organisations have the opportunity to significantly improve the protection of their customers' data through OIDC, OAuth2, and passkeys. 

In my spare time, I run [securemessagingapps.com](https://securemessagingapps.com). 

I'm originally from New Zealand, and I currently live in Geelong, Australia with my wife and two sons.
